Song pointer table
===================
The song pointer table, consisting of sequences for both music and sound effects, consists of 16-bit (2 byte) values. It can be found using the following code:
	ld hl, SongTable
	add l
	ld l, a
	ld a, 00
	adc h
	ld h, a
	ld e, [hl]
	inc hl
	ld d, [hl]

Which equals the following in hex:
21 ?? ?? 85 6F 3E 00 8C 67 5E 23 56

Alternatively, in some games, it uses the following code:
	add a, HIGH (SongTable)
	ld l, a
	ld a, LOW (SongTable)
	adc a, 00
	ld h, a
	ld e, [hl]
	inc hl

Which equals the following in hex:
C6 ?? 6F 3E ?? CE 00 67 5E 23

Song headers
===================
Each song (or sound effect) has a "header" consisting of the following:
1. Channel mask
2. Channel number:
   0-3 = Music 1-4
   4-7 = SFX 1-4
3-4. Pointer to channel
(Repeat 2-4 for each channel)
5. End of header

Song commands
===================
Song commands work as follows:
xx (00-3F) = Set note length
xx (40-7F?) = Play note
xx yy (X = 80-BF?) = Play note with manual length?
C0 = Set noise type
C1 xx = Noise sweep effect 
C2 xx = Set tuning
C3 xx = Portamento effect
C4 xx = Set volume/envelope
C5 = Turn on "buzz" effect?
C6 = Turn off "buzz" effect?
C7 xx = Set note size
C8 xx = Wave setting?
C9 = Rest
CA = Turn on effect mode?
CB = Turn off effect mode?
CC xx = Set tempo
CD xxxx = Set instrument (pointer)
CE xx yyyy = Repeat section # times (x = # of times, y = pointer)
CF xx yyyy = Repeat section # times (x = # of times, y = pointer)
D0 xxxx = Go to loop point
D1 xxxx = Go to macro
D2 = Exit macro
D3 = Stop channel
D4 xx = Tom tom effect
D5 = Disable tom tom?
D6 = Turn on "distortion pitch" mode
D7 = Turn off "distortion pitch" mode
D8 xx = Set transpose
D9 xx = Play drum?
DA xx = Repeat the following note X times
DB xx yy zz = Set vibrato
DC = Enable vibrato?
DD = Disable vibrato?
DE = ? (some games only)
DF xx = ? (some games only)
E0 xx = ? (some games only)
